# MIT-6.5840: Distributed Systems - Spring 2023

This repository documents my journey through the MIT-6.5840 Distributed Systems course in Spring 2023. The course presents abstractions and implementation techniques for engineering distributed systems, with major topics including fault tolerance, replication, and consistency.

## Introduction

This section provides an overview of the course and the labs.

## Lab 1: MapReduce

### Objective

The first lab focuses on MapReduce, a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating big data sets with a parallel, distributed algorithm on a cluster.

### Process

(Document your process here)

### Results

(Document your results here)

### Reflection

(Document your reflection here)

## Lab 2: Raft

### Objective

The second lab focuses on Raft, a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance.

### Process

(Document your process here)

### Results

## Lab 3: KV Raft

### Objective

The third lab focuses on implementing a key/value service on top of the Raft consensus algorithm.

### Process

(Document your process here)

### Results

## Lab 4: Sharded KV

### Objective

The fourth lab focuses on sharding the key/value service to distribute the data across multiple Raft groups.

### Process
